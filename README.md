CO₂-Control: Smart Home CO₂ Monitoring and Automation

Project Overview
This project is designed to monitor indoor air quality by measuring CO₂ levels, temperature, and humidity. Based on these readings, it can automatically trigger smart
home devices such as:

Ventilation Systems (HVAC, Exhaust Fans)
Air Purifiers
Smart Windows and IoT-Controlled Devices

The system provides real-time data visualization on a TFT display and can integrate with IoT protocols such as MQTT, Zigbee, or Wi-Fi for smart home automation.

Features
Real-time CO₂ Monitoring – Reads CO₂ concentration in parts per million (ppm) using the SCD30 sensor.
Color-Coded Air Quality Display – Green for good air quality, yellow for moderate, and red for poor air quality.
I2C-Based Sensor Communication – Utilizes SDA and SCL pins for efficient data exchange.
TFT Display for Live Updates – Displays CO₂ concentration, temperature, and humidity.
LED Indicator for Alerts – Blinks to signal high CO₂ levels.
Future IoT Integration – Can be extended to support smart home automation platforms such as Home Assistant, Google Home, or Alexa.
Hardware Components
